# pH7CMS I18N - Internationalization

pH7CMS Internationalization package. Currently there are **French** (Fran√ßais) and **Dutch** (Nederlands), (20%/30% translated approximately).

Please feed free to contribute (by forking the repo and commit it) by translated the files and adding new languages.


If you want to translate new languages, start with `global.pot` Gettext file. You can use software such as [Poedit](http://poedit.net/) to make the translation much easier. Then, don't forget to compile it in order to get `global.mo` file and upload it in "binary" format using an FTP client such as Filezilla or WinSCP.


## How to Install Those Languages?

- Upload the `_protected/` folder to your protected pH7CMS's installation with a FTP client such as [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org).

- *Optional:* Open *pH7CMSLangs.sql* file. Replace `pH7_` by your prefix set in "~/_protected/app/configs/config.ini" [database] prefix variable. Then, execute the file through phpMyAdmin.
